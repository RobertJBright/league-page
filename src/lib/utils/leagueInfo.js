  <p>Founded in XXXX, the Goosepack Gridiron Fantasy Football League began as redraft league amongst a small group of degenerates who called themselves friends. In 2022, the league converted into a full-fledged dynasty league.</p>
  <p>Some managers built immediate win-now teams, you know who you are, while others began the slow process of building a juggernaut dynasty team. A portion of the league prioritized youth and draft picks, the rest gravitated towards the steadfast value of veterans. While some managers fled from injuries and down years, others bought the dip and built for the future.</p>
  <p>Not all things in life are certain and tomorrow isn't promised, but some things are...there will be lineup mistakes, there will be bad trades, someone will still attempt to draft Roddy White in 2030. Most importantly, at the end of each season, someone will claim the Goosepack Gridiron Fantasy Championship and etch their name into the Hall of Legends.</p>
